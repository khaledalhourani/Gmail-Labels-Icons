Gmail Labels Icons
==========
This Greasemonkey script adds cool icons to your labels instead of only colors.


How to use it?
------------
Install 'Greasemonkey':https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/748 Firefox Addon.
Restart Firefox for sure.
Go to 'gmail_labels_icons.user.js':http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/85421 and click Install.
Now refresh your Gmail inbox page
Click on the square besides any label (the same color square) and tada! you'll see the icons above the colors


Common issues
------------
It's still an alpha testing script
It may take time to show the icons because my server is slower than Gmail, duh!
You can't set back colors instead of icons (I'm trying to solve it very soon)
